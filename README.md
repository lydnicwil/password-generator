# password-generator
https://lydnicwil.github.io/password-generator/

This is a basic password generator that allows for users to choose the length of their password (between 8-128 characters) and the types of characters allowed in their password.

It allows for both lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols.

The issues with it are that the sliding bar to choose the length doesnt actually tell you how many characters it is at, so it is hard for a user to see how long their password will be.
